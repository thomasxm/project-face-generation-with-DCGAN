# project-face-generation-with-DCGAN
In this project, we use deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
## Topics: 
* Machine learning
* Deep learning
* Classification
* Human face generation
* Unsupervised learning
* Convolutional neural networks
* Transposed convolutional neural layer
* Generative adversarial nets
* DCGAN
* Regularization
* Feedforward neural networks
* Backward propagation
* Activation functions
* Hyper-parameters tuning
* Adaptive learning rate
* Pytorch



## Extension:
* Create a deeper model and use it to generate larger (say 128x128) images of faces.
* Read existing literature to see if you can use padding and normalization techniques to generate higher-resolution images.
* Implement a learning rate that evolves over time as they did in this CycleGAN Github repo [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).
* See if you can extend this model and use a CycleGAN to learn to swap different kinds of faces. For example, learn a mapping between faces that have and do not have eye/lip makeup, as they did in this paper[here](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/pubs/Chang_2018_PAS/Chang-CVPR-2018.pdf).
